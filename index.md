Welcome to Whole Genome Sequece (WGS) analysis of head lice

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps that I took to analyse a WGS dataset from raw to anaylysis ready. The data is from a non-model organism (refer to about section below) and thus will follow the traditional data-analysis pipelines are are used for human data. The raw sequencing files will be deposited into ncbi in the near future. 

#### About the dataset  

The dataset is from a 'human head lice WGS project' in the Reed Lab at the Florida Museum of Natural History. I used Illumina short paired-end reads that were already demultiplexed to remove barcodes. Dataset was also trimmed based on the quality, which resulted in raw fastq paired-end reads. Process of demultiplexing and trimming is unfortunately not a part of this tutorial. Programs that my colleague used to do this are trimmomatic, fastQC and multiQC.

#### Step 1: Mapping reads to a reference 

This section assumes that you already have a reference genome available for your species. If you don't, there are some additional steps that you need to take to first assemble your raw reads to contigs (not a part of this tutorial).

There are mutiple programs that you can use to align your raw reads to a reference genome. The most commonly used programs are BWA, Bowtie2 and NovoAlign. If you are interested in learning about their performance please refer to this [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28286147/) among many that you can find on google scholoar.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/niyomiw/louse_genome/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
