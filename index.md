# Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis of Head lice 

Welcome to Whole Genome Sequece (WGS) analysis of head lice

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps that I took to analyse a WGS dataset from raw to anaylysis ready. Please feel free to click on any sub-section on the left to skip ahead or follow the tutorial from top to bottom. The raw sequencing files will be deposited into ncbi in the near future. 

#### About the dataset  

I used Illumina short paired-end reads that were already demultiplexed to remove barcodes. Dataset was also trimmed based on the quality, which resulted in raw fastq paired-end reads. Process of demultiplexing and trimming is unfortunately not a part of this tutorial. Programs that my colleague used to do this are trimmomatic, fastQC and multiQC.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/niyomiw/louse_genome/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
