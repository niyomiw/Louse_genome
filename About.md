####Project details 

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps that I took to analyse a WGS dataset from raw to anaylysis ready. The data is from a non-model organism (refer to about section below) and thus will follow the traditional data-analysis pipelines are are used for human data. The raw sequencing files will be deposited into ncbi in the near future.
